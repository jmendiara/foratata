# foratata

Concurrent TaskQueue with lifecycle notification in typescript (alike a Promise.map with concurrency and continue on failure)

NodeJS only (if somebody interested on browser, please open issue)

## Getting Started
```sh
npm i foratata
```

### Basic Usage
```js
import { TaskQueue } from 'foratata';

// Create the queue
const queue = new TaskQueue();

// add tasks: functions that run workloads
queue.push(
  () => delay(1000), // a promise
  () => { throw new Error() }, // something that throws (sync or async)
  () => whatever(), // something sync
);

// Run the queue with concurrency.
 // 2 simultaneous tasks as a time
queue.run(2) // promise here!
  .catch((err) => console.error(err)) // error abstract with all errors
```

All queue lifecycle is emmited as events, and you can subscribe to them to have some feedback on how is going.
We ship an event subscriber that outputs to console.

```js
import { TaskQueue, ConsoleSubscriber } from 'foratata';

// Create the queue
const queue = new TaskQueue();

const unsubscribe = ConsoleSubscriber(queue);
// calling unsubscribe() will stop listening to events
```
