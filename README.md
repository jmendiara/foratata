# foratata

Concurrent TaskQueue with lifecycle notification in typescript (alike a Promise.map with concurrency and continue on failure)

NodeJS only (if somebody interested on browser, please open issue)

## Getting Started
```sh
npm i foratata
```

### Basic Usage
```js
import { TaskQueue } from 'foratata';

// Create the queue
const queue = new TaskQueue();

// add tasks: functions that run workloads
queue.push(
  () => delay(1000), // a promise
  () => { throw new Error() }, // something that throws (sync or async)
  () => whatever(), // something sync
);

try {
  // Run the queue with concurrency.
  // 2 simultaneous tasks as a time
  const res = await queue.run(2);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err); // error abstract with all errors
}
```

### Advanced
```js
import { TaskQueue } from 'foratata';

// Give the queue a name and specify the concurrency
const queue = new TaskQueue('MyQueue', 2);

// Create tasks with a title for better traceability
const task = () => delay(1000);
task.title = 'A task';

queue.push(task);

// Lifecycle events
queue.on('taskStart',   ({ task }) =>               console.log(`START    ${task.title}`));
queue.on('taskSuccess', ({ task, time, result }) => console.log(`SUCCESS  ${task.title} took ${time}ms and the result was`, result));
queue.on('taskError',   ({ task, time, error  }) => console.log(`ERROR    ${task.title} took ${time}ms and the error  was`, error));
queue.on('taskComplete',({ task, time }) =>         console.log(`COMPLETE ${task.title} took ${time}ms`));

queue.on('start',    ({ concurrency, size })     => console.log(`QUEUE START with ${size} items and ${concurrency} tasks in parallel`));
queue.on('complete', ({ time, results, errors }) => console.log(`QUEUE ENDED in ${time}ms`, errors, results));

// Anidate queues
const otherQueue = new TaskQueue();
queue.push(otherQueue.toTask());

await queue.run(); // uses the constructor concurrency. Or all in parallel if none was specified
```

### Notifications
All queue lifecycle is emmited as events, and you can subscribe to them to have some feedback on how is going.
We ship an event subscriber that outputs to console.

```js
import { TaskQueue, ConsoleSubscriber } from 'foratata';

// Create the queue
const queue = new TaskQueue();

const unsubscribe = ConsoleSubscriber(queue);
// calling unsubscribe() will stop listening to events
```

## Development setup

To clone the repository use the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmendiara/foratata && cd foratata
```

Use [VSCode development containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers),  directly [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

```sh
# Shell interactive session inside a container
docker-compose run app bash
```
